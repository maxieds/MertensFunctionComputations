# Summary of the catalog of supporting Mathematica notebooks

* [GInvFunctionSequenceCalculations.nb](https://github.com/maxieds/MertensFunctionComputations/blob/master/MathematicaNotebooks/GInvFunctionSequenceCalculations.nb): Computational data related to the Dirichlet inverse function sequence. This includes generation of tables, verification of some identities for small n, and definitions and tables of auxiliary sequences.
* [KeyAndAuxiliarySequenceDistributions.nb](https://github.com/maxieds/MertensFunctionComputations/blob/master/MathematicaNotebooks/KeyAndAuxiliarySequenceDistributions.nb): Supporting computations, symbolic integration and summations, and other scratch work compendia related to the proofs of normal-tending distributions for key sequences expanding M(x) in the article.
* [MiscOtherTopics.nb](https://github.com/maxieds/MertensFunctionComputations/blob/master/MathematicaNotebooks/MiscOtherTopics.nb): Other topics related to the article that do not fit elsewhere. Organized and annotated by subtopic.
