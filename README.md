# Computations with the Mertens function

## Ideas and sketch to fill in

* Curious properties of the summatory functions $G^{-1}(x)$
* Dirichlet inverses: Computation, properties, and component sequences
* Tables of $g^{-1}(n)$ and its summatory function
* Tables of the lambda summatory function approximations
* Symmetric GFs and computing the DGF coefficient 
  lower bounds based on these
